Selling the shoes from the boot of his Plymouth, knight grossed $8000 in his first year. Today, nike's annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of start-ups, nike is the ne plus ultra of all start-ups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognisable symbols in the world today. But knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, he tells his story. Candid, humble, wry and gutsy, he begins with his crossroads moment when he decided to start his own business. He details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream - along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls how his first band of partners and employees soon became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything. A memoir rich with insight, humour and hard-won wisdom, this book is also studded with lessons - about building something from scratch, overcoming adversity, and ultimately leaving your mark on the world."

And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people. How to manage money, invest it, and make business decisions are typically considered to involve a lot of mathematical calculations, where data and formulae tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world, people don?t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together. In the psychology of money, the author shares 19 short stories exploring the strange ways people think about money and teaches you how to make better sense of one of life?s most important matters."

Beginning from his childhood, his family life, to finding his guru and becoming a monk and establishing his teachings of Kriya Yoga meditation, this book allows the reader to see the spiritual yearning of the man and how he realizes that over the years. It draws on both his personal experiences?anecdotes and meetings with eminent spiritual personalities, his association with nineteenth-century master Lahiri Mahasaya who had prophesized the writing of this book?as well as how he travels across America lecturing and establishing his teachings in Los Angeles, California.Autobiography of a Yogi is an introduction to the methods of attaining God-realization and emphasizes the value of Kriya Yoga and a life of self-respect, calmness, determination, simple diet and regular exercise. It has been in print for the last seventy years and has been translated into over forty languages. It has been highly acclaimed as a spiritual classic and is designated as one of the ?100 Most Important Spiritual Books of the 20th Century.?"
